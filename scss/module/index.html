    <!-- module use for simple file use -->
    <p>You don’t have to write all your Sass in a single file. You can split it up however you want with the @use rule.
        This rule loads another Sass file as a module, which means you can refer to its variables, mixins, and functions
        in your Sass file with a namespace based on the filename. Using a file will also include the CSS it generates in
        your compiled output!</p>
